    <h1>About Frugality</h1>
    <p>\tHave you ever bought something and wondered? Did I purchase that for a decent price? The television you
        bought, the lipstick, even something as petty as broccoli. Maybe you could have done better. Maybe you

        weekly, sometimes daily? This app is designed to keep you informed of these price changes. Frugality,
        which is co-op with one of the leading database companies in the country, is here to provide you with
        the best shopping tool ever.
