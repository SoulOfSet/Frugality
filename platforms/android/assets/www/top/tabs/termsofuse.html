<h2></h2>
<p>
    Thanks for using the Frugality app. Frugality allows you to access the retail intelligence database
    providing product information on a national level.<br>
</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>
    By accessing, downloading, or using the Frugality app, you are agreeing to:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>the Google Terms of Service (the "Universal Terms");</li>
    <li>the Google Play Terms of Service (Google Play Terms);</li>
    <li>the Maps/Google Earth (the "Maps/Earth Additional Terms");</li>
    <li>the Google Maps/Google Earth Legal Notices (the "Legal Notices");</li>
    <li>the Google Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy")</li>
    <li>the Frugality Terms of service</li>
</ol>
<p>Please read each of these four documents carefully, starting with the Universal Terms. The Universal
    Terms clarify, for example, your intellectual property ownership rights in the content you upload,
    and your responsibilities when using Frugality content or third-party content or when using Google
    Maps/Google Earth while driving.
</p>
<p>Collectively, we refer to the Frugality Terms, Universal Terms, the Maps/Earth Additional Terms, the
    Legal Notices, and the Privacy Policy as the "Agreement". The Agreement is a binding contract between
    you, Frugality, and Google regarding your use of The Frugality app.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>License. Subject to the Agreement's terms, Google grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable
        license to use Frugality, including features that allow you to:</li>

    </ul>
    <li>Prohibited Conduct. When using Frugality</li>
    <ul>
        <li>redistribute or sell any part of Frugality or create a new product or service based on Frugality</li>
        <li>copy the Content (unless you are otherwise permitted to do so by the Frugality or applicable intellectual
            property law, including "fair use");</li>

        <li>use any part of Frugality with other people's products or services </li>
        <li>reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from Frugality or any related software, except to
            the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law;</li>
        <li>f.	remove, obscure, or alter any Frugality terms of service or any links to or notices of those terms,
            or any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices;</li>

            publicity, and intellectual property rights).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Your Content in Google Maps/Google Earth. Content you upload, submit, store, send, or receive through
        Google Maps/Google Earth is subject to Google’s Universal Terms, including the license in the section entitled
        “Your Content in our Services”. However, content that remains exclusively local to your device (such as a
        locally-stored KML file) is not uploaded or submitted to Google, and is therefore not subject to that
        license.</li>
    <li>Government Users. If you are using our Services on behalf of a government entity, the following terms apply:
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Government Uses of Our Services. The Universal Terms section entitled “Business uses of our Services”
            is replaced in its entirety with the following:<br>
            <p>“If you are using our Services on behalf of a government entity, that entity accepts these terms.
                Solely to the extent permitted by applicable law, regulation, or
                privileges and immunities, that entity will hold harmless and indemnify Frugality and its affiliates,
                officers, agents and employees from any claim, action or proceedings arising from or related to the use
                of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims,
                losses, damages, judgements, litigation costs and legal fees.”</p></li>

        <ul>
            <li>For city or state government entities in the United States and European Union, the Universal Terms
                section regarding governing law and venue will not apply.</li>
            <li>For United States federal government entities, the Universal Terms section regarding governing law and
                venue is replaced in its entirety with the following:<br>
            <p>“This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
                United States of America without reference to conflict of laws. Solely to the extent permitted by
                federal law: (A) the laws of the State of California (excluding California’s conflict of laws rules)
                will apply in the absence of applicable federal law; and (B) any dispute arising out of or relating to
                this Agreement or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal courts of Santa Clara
                County, California, and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.”</p></li>
        </ul>
        <li>U.S. Government Restricted Rights. All access or use of Frugality by or for the United States federal
            government is subject to the "U.S. Government Restricted Rights" section in the Legal Notices.</li>
